# Hivemind - a screeps bot

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Mirroar/hivemind/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Mirroar/hivemind)

## Info

This is an open source bot for the game [screeps](https://screeps.com), intended to be used as a fully automated partner / opponent on private servers.

Most of the code originated from an AI written on the official servers. It is intended to be used without interaction, but there are some things that can be triggered manually, and the bot can be customized through several settings.

## Official servers

If you're just starting out with screeps, you're probably better off trying to write your own AI instead of using a developed AI such as this one as a base. Much of the game's fun comes from figuring out solutions yourself and then watching your code run like a (more or less) well-oiled machine.

Nonetheless, nobody can stop you from using this code on the official servers.
