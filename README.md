# Hivemind - a screeps bot

## Info

This is a bot for the game [screeps](https://screeps.com), intended to be used as a fully automated partner / opponent on private servers.

Most of the code originated from an AI written on the official servers. Due to that, several mechanisms for manually interacting with it still exist, mostly triggered by placing flags. Nonetheless, this code is intended to be used without interaction, and the aforementioned mechanisms might be removed in future versions.

## Official servers

If you're just starting out with screeps, you're probably better off trying to write your own AI instead of using a developed AI such as this one as a base. Much of the game's fun comes from figuring out solutions yourself and then watching your code run like a (more or less) well-oiled machine.

Nonetheless, nobody can stop you from using this code on the official servers.
